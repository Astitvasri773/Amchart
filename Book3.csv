In these cases larger hoardings may be appropriate. Perimeter fences can be constructed from a range of materials, including metal mesh. If a fence is to be used then it should be difficult to climb. Using a close mesh which prevents children getting their hands and feet through should mean that no one can gain handholds or footholds. Sectional fencing should be locked together and not easily separated without using a tool from the inside of the site. Note: close mesh fencing means climbing fencing is to be made difficult by the gap between the wires being 50mm. Many panels are 100mm wide and in addition they are not creating a 2m high barier.
